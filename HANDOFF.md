## Session Snapshot — What Just Landed (2026-06-16)

### Reconciliation + recovered macro work

**PRs #135–141 (now reflected here):** #135/#138 docs reconciliation, #136/#137 macro credit-cycle
harness + region long-run test (see below), #139 version bump to **v0.41.0**, #140/#141 title-screen
z-index fix (in-game HUD no longer bleeds through the title screen) → **v0.41.1**.

**Recovered the stranded macro harness.** PRs #136 and #137 had been merged into the
`claude/loving-gates-3luzuc` *sub-branch* but never PR'd to `main`, so their ~14 tests + the
`sim:macro` harness were missing from trunk while PLAN.md already claimed them. This session
cherry-picks the two feature commits back onto main (pure additive, no conflicts):

- **`src/sim/macro-headless.ts`** + **`npm run sim:macro -- [years] [runs] [policy]`** — runs the
  nation-tier monetary engine (`RegionSim.tickMonetary`) across 110 game-years and multiple seeds,
  with `passive` (pinned rate) and `taylor` (dovish growth mandate) reaction functions.
- **`tests/macro.test.ts`** (11 cases) CI-pins `analyzeCycles` + `policyRateFor`.
- **`tests/region-longrun.test.ts`** (3 cases): 1900–2010 stays finite/in-clamp; 50-year run is
  byte-identical for a fixed seed; distinct seeds diverge.
- **Key finding (addressed in a follow-up PR):** credit busts were = **0/century** — confidence
  never moved off 70, leverage topped out ~2.0, so the cycle **under-emerged** (GDD §13.3 risk #3).
  Fixed by adding a **Minsky leverage-fragility term** to `RegionSim.tickMonetary`: a high *level*
  of private leverage (above `LEVERAGE_FRAGILE = 1.6`… tuned to 1.5) erodes confidence at
  `FRAGILITY_GAIN` per unit, independent of debt service. Under an active dovish banker the harness
  now reports **~2.9 busts/century, 0 depressions** (on target); the `passive` (pinned-neutral)
  control stays dormant (leverage never builds), confirming it's the credit cycle, not noise. Pinned
  by two end-to-end cases in `tests/macro.test.ts`.

Test baseline restored to **839** (825 on main + 14 recovered), then **841** with the cycle-emergence
tests.

## Session Snapshot — What Landed (2026-06-15)

### PR #134 — TownCore parity completion + research + live-game UX (52 commits, +4,004/−146; suite 709 → **825** tests)

The largest bundle to date. It closes the **B-6 behavior-parity gap** on the SoA `TownCore`,
adds the colony's first tech tree, and ships a wave of live-game UX. Three threads:

**1. `TownCore` reaches fat-sim parity (town tier).** Added on the deterministic core:
- **Random-event deck** — full auto deck (cold snap, rats, festival, fever, bumper harvest,
  windfall timber, skill breakthrough, storm, injured worker, merchant, settler feud) plus
  **choice events** (trader caravan, bandit demand, refugees, feud, scholar) and
  plague / found-gold / heatwave / wandering-healer / mineral-strike. `pendingChoice` serialized.
- **Seasonal farming + drought** (`weather.growthMult` → field yield), **colony-wide food-variety
  mood**, **clothing distribution + warmth decay**, **ale** as food+recreation, **burial-ground
  room** + unburied-dead / slept-on-ground mood penalties.
- **Progression & economy:** prestige + era progression, difficulty system + `startColony()`
  convenience ctor, town focus + town name, standing trade orders, 7-day stock history + `netFlow()`.
- **Content:** deer herd + hunting lodge, fishing → `fish_meal`, housing-preference mood bonus,
  flax harvest zone (loom chain), watchtower early-warning, spike traps, meal-spoilage cap,
  emigration, forester sapling regrowth, well + yard room, market room + stalls (passive gold),
  carpentry bench (wood → tools) + rope scaffolding bonus, barracks + drill.

**2. TownCore research system** — `src/sim/research.ts` (`ResearchBook`): 12 `CoreTechDef` across 3
tiers, library-desk point generation (10 pts/day), auto-research queue, prereq checks, serialization.
Real effects: `crop_rotation` (free) field yield ×1.25, `militia_training` +30% settler melee in raid
& wolf defense (via `defenderDamageMult` on `RaidForce.tick`/`WolfPack.tick`), `crop_science` stacks
to ×1.45. **TownCore save format bumped through v7 → v10** (research book, event timer, season tracker,
clothing/festival/milestone/drought state all serialized; old saves backfill).

**3. B-6 Stage 4 view adapter DONE + play-test + live UX.**
- **Iterator API** so renderers never reach into SoA columns: `TownCore.settlers()`,
  `stationViews()`, `raiders()` generators (+ `SettlerView`/station/raider view interfaces).
- **`core.html` is now a playable colony sim** — room paint (Z, `[`/`]` cycles 14 types), station
  tool (A, `,`/`.` cycles 19 types), gate (G), bare floor (D), unified erase (E), click-to-inspect
  settler overlay, expanded stats overlay; `index.html?core` routes the main app URL to it.
- **Live game (`sim.ts` + HUD):** research queue UI + per-tech ETA + tech descriptions, weather &
  temperature HUD, drought/flood overlays + HUD indicator, day/night cycle, prestige (pop milestones
  25/50/100/200, tiers, raid-survival), Y-key focus cycle, sick indicator + colony-health HUD +
  food-projection HUD, scholar event, library + infirmary + starting herbs in the founding town,
  tile hover tooltip, services HUD, winter tint, tools build bonus, immigration gates. Live save
  (`sim.ts`) stays `v: 3`; the **main-app `SAVE_VERSION` is 10**. Comprehensive event tests added.

---

PRs #131–132 added AI sprite generation on top of the PNG override pipeline from PR #130:

- **`scripts/hf-sprites.ts`** — CLI that calls the Hugging Face Inference API to generate pixel-art sprites and drops them into `public/sprites/`, updating `index.json`. Registered as `npm run hf-sprites`.
- **Model:** `nerijs/pixel-art-xl` (SDXL LoRA trained on pixel art). Generates at 512px+, 25 steps, `guidance_scale 7`, with a `negative_prompt` that suppresses smooth/realistic output. The browser's `applyOverrides()` scales the result to each slot's canvas size.
- **61 slots catalogued** with tuned prompts: terrain (grass, tree, water, rock, soil stages), build system (palisade, gate, floor, wall plans), creatures (settlers ×3 variants ×4 frames, raiders, wolves, deer), and items (wood, stone, grain, meal, tools, weapons, …).

**Quick usage:**
```bash
# Preview what would be generated (no API call)
npx tsx scripts/hf-sprites.ts --dry-run

# Generate all sprites
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx npm run hf-sprites

# Generate a subset
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx npm run hf-sprites -- --slots=tree,grass-0,rock

# Use a different model
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx npm run hf-sprites -- --model=stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0
```

Generated PNGs land in `public/sprites/<name>.png` and are registered in `public/sprites/index.json`. The game loads them automatically on next page refresh — no code change needed. See `public/sprites/README.md` for the full slot-naming convention.

PR #121 merged three major UI systems and fixed a critical FPS regression:

1. **Zoom-LOD rendering** (`src/ui/render.ts`): tiles collapse to flat colors at zoom < 0.4; decorative overlays (HP bars, status marks, graves) gate at zoom < 0.5. No visual pop; smooth FPS curve from 76fps (zoomed in) to 30fps+ (overview).

2. **WindowManager** (`src/ui/WindowManager.ts`): draggable panel system with localStorage persistence and z-order control. Grab-from-background only (excludes buttons/inputs). Converts CSS-anchored panels (e.g., `right: 0`) to left/top on first drag.

3. **Tabbed UI** (across `hud.ts` + `regionview.ts`): inspector resources/priorities/diplomacy split into tabs; town/state/economy panels organized into logical tab groups; Finance tab further split into Treasury/Credit sub-tabs. CSS-driven switching (no DOM rebuild). 60% reduction in vertical scroll per panel.

4. **Statehood banner fix**: moved up 6px to clear the opaque DOM bottombar (was hidden at zoom out).

---

## Key Architecture Patterns

### 1. WindowManager Pattern — What to Know

**File:** `src/ui/WindowManager.ts` (add to any HUD that needs draggable windows)

**Quick start:**
```typescript
const wm = new WindowManager([
  { id: 'inspector', element: inspectorEl, baseZ: 20 },
  { id: 'priorities', element: prioritiesEl, baseZ: 19 },
]);
// Later, add a panel dynamically:
wm.register({ id: 'myPanel', element: panelEl, baseZ: 15 });
```

**How it works:**
- Listens for `mousedown` at document level (capture phase)
- If the click lands on something in `NO_DRAG` selector (buttons, inputs, `.prio`, `.trade-btn`, etc.), the drag is skipped
- Otherwise, records the drag offset and moves the element until `mouseup`
- On release, saves the position to localStorage
- Raises the window to `zIndex = FOCUS_Z (1000)` on click; restores previous z-index when another window takes focus

**Adding a new draggable panel:**
1. Ensure the panel has a `data-window-id` attribute (WindowManager sets this automatically via `register()`)
2. If the panel contains interactive controls that shouldn't trigger drag, add their selectors to `NO_DRAG` (line 18)
3. Call `wm.register(cfg)` after the element exists in the DOM
4. Give it a unique `id`, the DOM element, and a `baseZ` (z-index when not focused)

**Why localStorage:** positions persist across sessions, so players don't have to reposition panels every time.

**Known limitation:** `NO_DRAG` is a static selector; if you add dynamic interactive content (e.g., a popover menu) after init, update `NO_DRAG` or add a data attribute to the new element.

### 2. Tab System Pattern — What to Know

**Pattern:** State variable + CSS visibility toggle + click handler delegation.

**Example — Finance sub-tabs (from `regionview.ts`):**

```typescript
// State:
let financeSubTab: 'treasury' | 'credit' = 'treasury';

// HTML (stays in DOM):
html`
  <div class="pal-tabs">
    <button class="pal-tab" data-restab="finance/treasury" ...>Treasury</button>
    <button class="pal-tab" data-restab="finance/credit" ...>Credit</button>
  </div>
  <div class="pal-subtabs" style=${financeSubTab === 'treasury' ? '' : 'display:none'}>
    <!-- Treasury content -->
  </div>
  <div class="pal-subtabs" style=${financeSubTab === 'credit' ? '' : 'display:none'}>
    <!-- Credit content -->
  </div>
`;

// Handler (mousedown delegation):
el.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
  const btn = e.target.closest('[data-restab]');
  if (!btn) return;
  const [main, sub] = btn.dataset.restab.split('/');
  if (main === 'finance' && sub === 'treasury') financeSubTab = 'treasury';
  if (main === 'finance' && sub === 'credit') financeSubTab = 'credit';
  render(); // redraw; CSS visibility toggle applies next frame
});
```

**Why not CSS-only tabs?** We tried: `input[type=radio]` + `:checked` sibling combinator is fragile and hard to style. The state-driven approach is simpler and integrates cleanly with the rest of the reactive codebase.

**When to use:** if a panel has > 5 logical sections, split it into tabs. Each tab should contain 50–150 lines of content (a full screen of text at default zoom). If a tab is too long, add sub-tabs (Finance example).

**Nesting sub-tabs:** Keep it to 2 levels max. Main tabs (25% of panel width each) + sub-tabs (CSS `.pal-subtabs` with 2–3 buttons). Deeper nesting is impossible to click on mobile.

### 3. Zoom-LOD Rendering Pattern — What to Know

**File:** `src/ui/render.ts` (lines ~650–750, where `drawMap()` dispatch happens)

**Pattern:**
```typescript
const lod = zoom < LOD_ZOOM;          // 0.4
const detailZoom = zoom >= 0.5;       // 0.5

// Tile passes:
if (!lod) {
  // Draw grass, trees, water, overlays (normal detail)
} else {
  // Draw collapsed tile colors (flat rects)
}

// Entity passes:
// Always draw entities (buildings, settlers, animals)

// Decorative passes:
if (detailZoom) {
  // Draw HP bars, status marks, carried items, graves, corpses
}
```

**Why two thresholds?** Tile LOD (0.4) gates the most expensive passes (tile grid iteration). Detail LOD (0.5) gates per-entity overlays (HP bars, status marks). The split allows:
- At 0.45x zoom: tiles are flat (cheap) but entities still have visual details (context)
- At 0.35x zoom: both tiles and details are flat (maximum performance for overview)

**Adding a new rendering pass:**
1. If it's per-tile (grass, trees, water), gate it behind `if (!lod)`
2. If it's per-entity detail (status icons, labels), gate it behind `if (detailZoom)`
3. Measure frame time; if new pass drops FPS > 5, consider gating it behind a third threshold

**Measuring performance:**
- `console.time('drawMap'); ...; console.timeEnd('drawMap')` in `main.ts` tick loop
- Chrome DevTools → Performance tab → Frame rate graph (target ≥ 30fps at overview zoom)

## Code Locations — Where Things Live

### HUD Panels (Inspector, Priorities, Diplomacy)
- **File:** `src/ui/hud.ts`
- **Dragging:** WindowManager (registered at `main.ts` init)
- **Tabs:** `resourceTab` state variable (lines ~100), `wireTabs()` helper (lines ~120), `resourcesCard()` renders active tab (lines ~400)
- **CSS:** `src/style.css` `.inspector`, `.insp-tabs`, `.insp-tab`

### Region Panels (Town, State, Economy, Research)
- **File:** `src/ui/regionview.ts`
- **Dragging:** WindowManager (registered at `main.ts` when entering region mode)
- **Tabs:** 
  - Main tabs: `panelTab` (town), `statePanelTab` (state), `economyTab` (economy), `researchTab` (research)
  - Sub-tabs: `financeSubTab` (treasury/credit), `economyTab` (overview/settlements)
  - `wireTabs()` helper at line ~XX (search for `function wireTabs`)
- **CSS:** `src/style.css` `.pal-tabs`, `.pal-tab`, `.pal-subtabs`, `.pal-subtab`
- **Integration:** `draggablePanels` getter returns inspector + priorities + region panels for WindowManager registration

### Zoom-LOD Rendering
- **File:** `src/ui/render.ts`
- **Constants:** `LOD_ZOOM = 0.4` (line ~XX), `detailZoom = 0.5` (line ~XX)
- **Tile color collapse:** `tileColor()` function (line ~XX)
- **Main dispatch:** `drawMap()` function, gated passes within

### Window Persistence
- **File:** `src/ui/WindowManager.ts`
- **localStorage key:** `centuria_windows` (JSON record of `{ panelId: { x, y } }`)
- **Drag logic:** `onDown()`, `onMove()`, `onUp()` methods

## Common Edits — How to Do Them

### Add a new tab to the Resources panel
1. Add a new case to `resourceTab` state (e.g., `'trade'`)
2. Add a new button in the tab row with `data-restab="trade"`
3. Add a new content div in `resourcesCard()` with `style=${resourceTab === 'trade' ? '' : 'display:none'}`
4. Add the handler in the mousedown listener: `if (restab === 'trade') resourceTab = 'trade'`
5. Test: click the tab, ensure it switches

### Add a new draggable panel
1. Create the panel HTML in `hud.ts` or `regionview.ts` with a unique ID (e.g., `'my-panel'`)
2. Add it to the `draggablePanels` getter's return array
3. Pass the array to `WindowManager` constructor in `main.ts`
4. Test: click and drag the panel, reload the page (position should persist)

### Adjust zoom-LOD thresholds
1. `LOD_ZOOM = 0.4` in `render.ts` — lower = tiles stay detailed longer (better visuals, worse FPS). Raise to improve FPS at cost of detail.
2. `detailZoom = 0.5` in `render.ts` — gates HP bars, status marks. Adjust similarly.
3. Rerun with `npm run dev` and zoom out while watching frame time in console
4. Goal: ≥ 30fps at zoom 0.2, ≥ 60fps at zoom 1.0+

### Split a tall panel into tabs
1. Identify logical sections (e.g., "Overview", "Settlements", "Settings")
2. Create a state variable (e.g., `let myPanelTab = 'overview'`)
3. Move each section's HTML into a separate `<div>` with conditional `display:none`
4. Add buttons with `data-resub="sectionName"` to the tab row
5. Add a click handler to switch the state variable and re-render

---

## Testing

**Unit tests:** `npx vitest run` (825 tests, ~100s)  
**Type check:** `npx tsc --noEmit` (must pass before commit)  
**Build:** `npm run build` (must pass before commit)  
**Manual test:** `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173 → play for 5 minutes at various zoom levels, check FPS and panel usability

**Smoke tests for UI changes:**
- Click every tab; ensure content switches correctly
- Drag every panel; refresh page; ensure position persists
- Zoom in/out; watch FPS at each threshold (goal ≥ 30fps at zoom 0.1–0.3)

## B-6 PART 3 — the swap, re-scoped (2026-06-15)

**Verdict from this session's verification:** repo is green (tsc + build clean, **825 tests** after
this session's stages) and
every PART 2 parity port is real. The raid GUI play-test is cleared. **But the swap is blocked
*structurally*, not by tuning** — a direct `TownCore`-for-`Simulation` swap would delete the playable
game because the live UI reads fat-sim shapes the SoA core lacks: a **World/terrain layer**, a
**building layer** (`buildings.json`), **fat settler objects** (vs SoA columns), an **event log**
(`sim.log`), **corpse/grave/item/animal arrays**, and **player build verbs**.

**Design decision (user):** target is **Songs of Syx** — *painted blueprints* for buildings (the
`BuildGrid` paint model wins; pre-placed buildings retire) **on complex terrain**. Full staged
roadmap in `PLAN.md` § *B-6 PART 3*. Status:
- **Stage 1 — terrain layer on `BuildGrid`** ✅ landed: `terrain`/`ore` Uint8 layers (grass/tree/
  water/soil/rock), terrain-aware `passable()`, deterministic `generateTerrain()`, base64
  serialization (old saves backfill to all-grass), opt-in `new TownCore({ terrain: true })`.
- **Stage 2 — harvest zones (Songs-of-Syx)** ✅ landed: a `zone` layer (field/woodcutter/quarry/
  fishery) designable only on matching terrain; `TownCore.harvestZones()` works them into raw goods
  daily (grain/wood/stone/iron_ore/meal), labour-capped, consuming zones deplete. `core.html` has
  paint tools + auto-zone. Yields are GUI-tunable flat constants.
- **Stage 3 — event log on `TownCore`** ✅ landed: `log: LogEntry[]` (`{ day, text, kind }`, the fat
  sim's shape) fed on founding/raids/wolves/deaths/births; save **v5** (old saves → empty log).
- **Stage 3b — settler names** ✅ landed: `AgentStore.names[]` (deterministic from id), through
  swap-remove, serialized; deaths/births named in the log.
- **Stage 4 — settler + collection view** ✅ landed (completed in PR #134): `TownCore.inspect(i) →
  SettlerView` for the HUD inspector, plus the renderer-facing iterator API —
  `settlers()` / `stationViews()` / `raiders()` generators so renderers never reach into SoA
  columns. (`tiles`/`zones`/`builds` iterables, if needed beyond the existing getters, land with the
  Stage 5 renderer.)
- **Stage 7 — blueprint construction** ✅ landed: `TownCore.builds[]` + `blueprintWall/Floor/Station`
  + `tickConstruction()` (materials + labour → real build), `cancelBlueprint`.
  `core.html`'s wall tool now paints blueprints the colony builds.
- **Research (PR #134)** ✅ landed: `src/sim/research.ts` (`ResearchBook`) — colony tech tree fed by
  library desks, with real raid/yield/health effects. Save bumped to **v10**.
- **Remaining: Stages 5, 6, 8 — renderer / live wiring / destructive swap.** These touch
  `render.ts`/`main.ts` (no test catches a regression), so land them in a session where the result
  can be watched. `core.html` + `src/coreview.ts` is the working SoA reference renderer to port from;
  the model layer (`TownCore`) is feature-complete and deterministic.

**Current SoA-core feature set (all on `TownCore`, deterministic + serialized):** terrain, harvest
zones + primary production, blueprint construction, room/station crafting, needs/mood/thoughts,
traits/skills, wounds/medical, relationships, weather, raids, wolves, town economy (loans/inflation),
settler names, event log (full random-event deck + choice events), seasonal farming/drought,
food-variety + clothing + burial mood systems, prestige/era progression, research tech tree,
`inspect()` + iterator view API. Save format **v10**.

## Next Steps (B-6 PART 2 Swap + Beyond)

**B-6 PART 2 — the live swap (still gated, NOT a "mechanical swap").**
Reality check: `TownCore` (~2,060 lines) is *not* a drop-in for `Simulation` (~3,860 lines) +
`region.ts` (~7,245 lines). The live `main.ts`/`render.ts`/`hud.ts`/`regionview.ts` are coupled to
`sim.settlers`/`sim.world`/`buildings.json`/the region flip — none of which the SoA core has. A
blind swap would *delete the playable game*. Do it incrementally, behind a flag, with a play-test.

- **Behavior parity port — done (PR #134).** On the SoA columns now: traits/skills, wounds/medical,
  relationships/thoughts, weather, market (buy/sell + daily price recovery), the **full random-event
  deck + choice events**, seasonal farming/drought, food-variety/clothing/burial mood systems,
  prestige/era progression, a **research tech tree** (`research.ts`), and **raids/combat**
  (`src/sim/raid.ts` — `RaidForce`/`raidSize()`; raiders converge, walls slow them, settlers rally
  as a militia, attackers flee on timeout; wired into `TownCore.tick` before the death pass).
  Tests: `tests/raid.test.ts` (15) + raid cases in `tests/parity.test.ts`.
- **Defense parity ports — done.** Three fat-sim threats/defenses now live on the SoA core:
  - **Spike traps** (`BuildGrid.trap` layer + `setTrap`/`tripTrap`, serialized): one-shot tiles that
    bite the first raider onto them for `TUNING.trapDamage`. Tripped in `RaidForce.advance`.
  - **Forged-weapon / spear bonuses** (`AgentStore.armed` column 0/1/2, serialized): `TownCore`
    arms the militia from the stores when a raid musters (`armColony` — forged `weapons` first, then
    wood `spears`); `settlerMeleeDamagePerHour` (exported from `raid.ts`) adds the tuned bonus for
    both raid and wolf defense.
  - **Wolf packs** (`src/sim/wolves.ts` — `WolfPack`, a smaller sibling of `RaidForce`): packs prowl
    in from an edge on a per-day roll (`TUNING.wolfFirstDay`/`wolfPackChancePerDay`), stalk and maul
    strays, the bitten fight back, and a mauled/overstayed wolf flees. Wired into `TownCore.tick` +
    `summonWolves`, serialized at save v3. Tests: `tests/wolves.test.ts` (8) + weapon/trap cases in
    `tests/raid.test.ts`.
- **Economy parity port (town tier) — done.** The town-tier slice of the fat sim's monetary stack now
  lives on the SoA core (`src/sim/ledger.ts` — `Ledger`):
  - **Lenders + loans**: three NPC lenders (`lenders.ts.createInitialLenders`); `TownCore.takeLoan`
    credits the treasury and records an amortizing loan; `repayLoan` pays it down manually. Each month
    (`day % 30`) interest accrues, the colony auto-services due installments from gold, and a loan
    overdue past a 90-day grace defaults (dropping the lender's confidence). Mirrors `region.ts`'s
    `requestLoan`/`repayLoan`/`updateLoans` — but with a deterministic loan-id counter, not the fat
    sim's `Math.random`.
  - **Inflation**: `TownCore.inflation` re-reckons monthly from the money supply (gold + outstanding
    debt) over a GDP proxy (`wealth()`), and rides on top of every market price via `priceMult`. A
    debt-free, coin-poor colony sits at 0% (so existing market tests are untouched); heavy borrowing
    prints money and lifts prices.
  - Save bumped to **v4** (ledger + inflation). Tests: `tests/ledger.test.ts` (15).
  - **Out of scope (region tier, swap territory):** GDP/tax engine, monetary-policy rate, bonds, FX,
    central bank, credit cycle — all welded to `region.ts`.
- **Play-test fixes (found by running `/core.html`):**
  - `BuildGrid` now has a **gate** (`setGate`/`clearGate`, serialized): a passable opening that still
    seals a room for enclosure — without it a fully-walled room was unreachable, so doored rooms
    were impossible. (This was a listed swap blocker; now done.)
  - **Rest/recreation are served colony-wide** in `TownCore` (`serveNeeds(..., colonyWide=true)`):
    settlers recover from total bed/table capacity instead of needing to stand in the room — the
    same global model already used for feeding. Before this, settlers slept where they collapsed,
    never recovered rest, and the colony starved. Regression: `towncore.test.ts` "survives and grows
    over 30 days" (the long-horizon test whose absence hid the bug).
- **Still missing before a swap is safe:** the `region.ts` flip and **raid balance tuning** (headless
  numbers are conservative — tune in the GUI). Spike traps, forged-weapon/spear bonuses and wolf packs
  are now ported (see the Defense parity ports note above).
- **Gate that remains: GUI play-test.** A *non-destructive parallel mode* now exists: `core.html`
  + `src/coreview.ts` boot a `TownCore` with a starter town and render it (agents/walls/stations/
  raiders + a stats overlay) in a real browser — `npm run dev` → `/core.html`. Controls: space
  pause · 1/2/3 speed · R raid now · N add settler · left-drag wall · right-drag erase. The live
  game (`main.ts`/`index.html`) is untouched. Use this to play-verify the core (esp. raid balance)
  before the destructive swap. ponytail: direct canvas draw, not the fat-sim `Renderer`.

**Future (after B-6 PART 2):**
- Phase 3 (Parcel purchase UI) — right-click fog cell, cost panel, purchase button (low friction; no new architecture)
- Phase 4 (Chunk rendering) — 3-mode zoom dispatch for seamless world (moderate complexity; coordinate math heavy)
- Phase 7 (Web Worker) — offload `TownCore` tick to worker thread (high architectural risk; follow pattern in `vite.config.ts` + `src/workers/`)

**Key invariant:** All new UI for phases 3–4 is temporary (replaced by Phase 4 renderer). Don't over-build the purchase UI; land the bare minimum (1–2 panels) and defer polish until Phase 4.

**Editing rules:**
- `WindowManager.ts` — can edit directly, small and isolated
- `hud.ts` + `regionview.ts` — coordinate with `style.css` for tab styling; search for the exact function before editing (line numbers drift)
- `render.ts` — always check frame time after edits; regressions are easy and hard to debug
- `style.css` — CSS-only; safe to edit but always test at multiple zoom levels

## Repo Health Checks (Do These Monthly)

```bash
# Test count stability
npm test 2>&1 | grep -i "passing\|failing"

# Type safety
npm tsc --noEmit

# Build size
npm run build && ls -lh dist/index.html

# Performance baseline (manual)
npm run dev
# Zoom in, 5s wait (should see 60fps)
# Zoom to 0.2x, 5s wait (should see 30fps+, no FPS drops > 5)
# Profiling: Chrome DevTools Performance tab, record 5s, check main thread time < 3ms per frame
```

## When Stuck

**FPS regression after edit:**
1. Undo the edit
2. Add `console.time('drawMap')` in `render.ts:drawMap()`, `console.timeEnd()` at the end
3. Note the time delta at zoom 0.5 and 0.2
4. Re-apply the edit; re-measure
5. If delta > 1ms, find which render pass is expensive and gate it behind LOD threshold

**Weird tab switching behavior:**
1. Check the state variable is declared at the right scope (function-level, not in a nested block)
2. Ensure `render()` is called after the state change (or the re-render won't see the new state)
3. Check `data-restab` attribute matches the handler's expected value

**Panel not dragging:**
1. Verify `data-window-id` is set on the panel element (WindowManager.register() does this)
2. Check that the clicked element is not in the `NO_DRAG` selector (look at line 18 in WindowManager.ts)
3. Verify localStorage is enabled in the browser (private mode disables it; the save silently fails but dragging still works)

**Build fails after package change:**
1. `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm ci`
2. `npx tsc --noEmit` (pinpoint the error)
3. If it's a type error in a new dependency, file a GH issue before merging
