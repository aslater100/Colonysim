## Ship loop

Each task = its own draft PR. Bump `package.json` version in the PR; push matching `v*` tag after merge.
User merges and play-tests; CI validates (test.yml — do not run the suite locally).

## Standing instructions

- Be frugal with tokens.
- Goal: "fully fleshed out game based on everything planned."

## What's next

GDD-aligned open items (roughly in order of pull):
- Eras 7–8 (2040–2100: solarpunk / dystopia / drowned endings)
- Full climate system (CO₂ ledger framework exists; impacts currently simplified to events)
- FX & monetary regimes (single-currency only today)
- Espionage + misinformation systems
- Historical scenarios (GDD §9)
- Animal husbandry + ranged combat polish (may be partially shipped; check src/)

## Architecture reference

- **Route kinds:** `'trail' | 'road' | 'rail' | 'highway' | 'maglev'`; `KIND_RANK` enforces upgrade-only; `buildLink` refuses downgrades.
- **Gates:** `railUnlocked()` = `stateProclaimed && year >= 1912`; highway = State + year ≥ 1945; maglev = State + year ≥ 2005 (each −5 years with its tech node). `maintBill(r)` is ×0.6 once `automated_logistics` is researched.
- **Save format:** v2 `{v:2, mode:'region', town, region}` under `centuria-save`; v1 town saves still load.
- **Clocks:** town = 4 game-min/tick; region = 30 game-min/tick (~6 s/day at speed 1).
- **Effective route capacity:** `capacity × condition/100`; condition floor 15; unpaid maintenance −6/mo; washouts −45 condition on storm days (12% chance), `repairRoute` restores to 100 from treasury.
- **Relief line:** `reliefLine(t)` = larger town reachable via road/rail → ×1.25 militia in raid branch of `fireEvent`.
- **Markets:** `routePath` with `usable` filter; arbitrage fires when margin > 1.5× freight (£0.01/unit/hop); clamped to remaining capacity after caravans; 5% State levy into treasury.
- **Policy effects:** ongoing monthly in `monthlyEconomy`; faction wiring in `updateFactions`.
- **Region events:** `routePath` for highwaymen — freight gate means quiet routes carry nothing worth robbing; earlier draft robbed subsistence and starved the harness.
- **Diplomacy:** rivals emerge in `updateDiplomacy` (monthly) from 1922, ≤6, archetype presets over §6.3 weights; regimes from `RIVAL_REGIMES` (10, era-gated, 4 blocs; `blocAffinity` feeds both player and pair baselines); treaty acceptance = `relations ≥ treatyAsk()` (personality-priced, +15/breach reputation penalty); hostile = relations < −40 with no NAP → sponsored raids (×1.3 strength, 50% per raid) and border friction; trade agreements pay `exportEarningsLastMonth` in `monthlyEconomy` (×1.5 during `warBoomUntil`).
- **The world's own politics:** `rivalPairs` (keyed `minId:maxId`) drift in `tickForeignRelations`; pairs > 45 + honor ally, > 25 + commerce open customs unions, < −20 trade ultimatums, < −50 → `startForeignWar` (240–720 days; refugee waves 20%/mo; peace bleeds the loser ~10–15% pop, sets the pair at −60, 50% defeat-topples its regime via era-gated `pickRegime`). Alliances block war within the pair and harden sides when wars start. Rival `history[]` accrues beats (capped 16, founding line kept).
- **Negotiation engine (GDD §6.3):** `evaluateDeal(rv, basket)` is pure (UI live-previews); basket = `{treaties, goldToThem, goldToYou, borderSettlement}`. Value to the rival: `treatyAppetite` (trade = commerce×1.6−4; NAP = (10−risk)×0.8+honor×0.3−3; pact = honor×0.8−risk×0.5−5), `borderAppetite` = (4−expansion)×1.2+grudge×0.4, gold at `(0.6+commerce×0.08)/GOLD_PER_POINT(8)` per £. Accept when `get ≥ give×premium + tableCost`; premium = 1+breaches×0.3+grudge×0.03−relations/150 (floor 0.5); tableCost = max(0,−relations/8)+breaches×2+grudge×0.4. Within 30% → counter-offer (gold sweetener, stored in `counters`, 90-day expiry, signable via `acceptCounter`); else walk with reason. `borderSettled` on the rival kills border friction + border CB (both ways: AI declares with `fabricated` instead) and adds +6 relations drift. `proposeTreaty` (single-item, relations-threshold) still exists alongside.
- **War depth (GDD §7.3–7.4):** `tickPlayerWar` skips the declaration day (`startedDay === day`) — the AI declares inside the same monthly tick, and resolving immediately made support assertions flaky (this was main's red CI). Blockade: `setBlockade` needs militia ≥ 2 or standing army; enemy power ×0.85 + pop ×0.997 + score +1.5/mo; costs `pop×0.02`/mo and exports ×0.6 (×0.7 in any war — contested lanes). Co-belligerence: `callAlly` on defensive-pact rivals — defensive war: honors if honor ≥ 4 (else honor/10 chance, refusal tears the pact publicly); offensive: needs relations ≥ 60 + honor-weighted chance. Called allies fight at `pop^0.6×0.5` (passive pacts 0.25), bleed at half lossRate, share peace (+8) and defeat (−10). Enemy alliance partners join at war start with `0.3+honor×0.05` chance, add `pop^0.6×0.3`. Occupation: score ≥ 35 → 30%/mo take a march (≤3, support +3); score < 0 → 25%/mo lose one; `OCCUPATION_DEFS` conciliatory (net £2/march, +2 resistance) vs brutal (net £7, +6, −5 legitimacy once, `brutality` flag → peace adds grudge +2, relations −15); resistance ×1.5 if blocs are hostile; > 50 → partisan attacks (casualties, score −2, support −1.5). Enemy raiders cut a random route −12 condition 30%/mo. Peace: `offerPeaceBasket(terms)` — ask = Σscores + grudge×2 − occupied×6; near miss (≥ ask−15, multi-term) → counter naming the signable subset; `border_province` requires occupied ≥ 1.
- **Player war (GDD §7):** one front at a time (`playerWar`), nation-tier only. CBs earned by hostility (`availableCasusBelli`: raids < −40 w/o NAP, border < −20, fabricated always at −10 legitimacy + breach). `warPower` = `totalPop^0.6 × quality(militia/standing army/defence minister/military reform/junta) × mobilization(1/1.6/2.3)` + defensive-pact allies at `pop^0.6 × 0.25`; rival = `pop^0.6 × (0.5 + exp×0.04 + risk×0.015)`. Monthly in `tickPlayerWar`: score ±16×ratio+rng, attrition bleeds bands 1–2 (`casualties` accrues), support decays/rallies; floors 45/45/35/25 (dem/rep/mon/junta) — below: legitimacy −2 + grievance; floor−15 → forced `capitulate` (treasury ×0.6, pop −4%, legitimacy −15/−25 junta), same as score ≤ −60. `offerPeace` ask = term score (0/30/55/80) + grudge×2; victory pays legitimacy +10 (+15 defensive), treasury ×0.9 demobilization, enemy pop ×0.92; annexation = grudge+3, relations −80 (Versailles trap); regime change → `changeRegime('defeat')`, relations 15. War pins enemy relations ≤ −60 and blocks envoy/gift/treaty verbs. Hostile rivals (< −60, no NAP) declare on the player risk/expansion-weighted; democracies need 6 months at war for Total mobilization unless defensive. Mobilization economics live in `monthlyEconomy` (`gdpMult` stimulus, `upkeepPerPop` drain).
